Description:  OghmaNano is a free organic solar cells model. It is specifically designed to
 simulate bulk-heterojuncton organic solar cells, such as those based on the
 P3HT:PCBM material system. The model contains both an electrical and an optical
 solver, enabling both current/voltage characteristics to be simulated as well
 as the optical modal profile within the device. The model and it's easy to use
 graphical interface is available for both Linux and Windows. The model can
 simulate:
 .
 -Dark JV curves
 -Light JV curves
 -Dark CELIV transients
 -Light CELIV transients
 -Voltage transients of an arbitrary shape
 -Full optical model taking into account reflection at interfaces and absorption.
 -Calculation of reflection profile
 -Ability to simulate OLEDs
 .
 The physical model solves both electron and hole drift-diffusion, and carrier
 continuity equations in position space to describe the movement of charge
 within the device. The model also solves Poisson's equation to calculate the
 internal electrostatic potential. Recombination and carrier trapping are
 described within the model using a Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) formalism, the
 distribution of trap sates can be arbitrarily defined. A fuller description of
 the model can be found in the at https://www.Oghma-Nano.com, in the associated
 publications  and in the manual. Example simulations
 .
 The model makes it easy to study the influence of material parameters such as
 mobility, energetic disorder, doping and recombination cross-sections on device
 performance. All internal device parameters such as current density, charge
 density, distribution of trapped carriers in position and energy space are
 accessible either through the graphical interface or directly through output
 files. simulate bulk-heterojuncton organic solar cells, such as those based on the
 P3HT:PCBM material system. The model contains both an electrical and an optical
