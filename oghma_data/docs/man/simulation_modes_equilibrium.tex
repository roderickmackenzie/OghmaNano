\section{Electrical equilibrium editor}
Sometimes when studding a device, it is not necessary to simulate an entire JV curve. One may for example just for example be interested in the band structure at 0V in the dark. The \emph{Electrical equilibrium} allows the user to setup simulations that only simulate the device at equilibrium (0V applied bias in the dark).
