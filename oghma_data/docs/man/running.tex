\section{Simulating a JV curve of a simple solar cell}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
No matter which type of device you want to simulate, if you are new to OghmaNano my advice is to start off with this organic solar cell simulation. Organic solar cells are by far the most simple class of device you can simulate, and will let you understand the basics of the package without having to deal with 2D effects, perovskite ions of light emission.  This chapter will guide you through your first organic solar cell and explain the nuts and bolts of running simulations with OghmaNano. Once installed OghmaNano appear on the start menu, click on it to launch it. Once run, a window resembling that in figure \ref{fig:new_open} will appear.
