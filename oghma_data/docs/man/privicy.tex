\section{Data privacy statement}
In some versions of OghmaNano it will ask you to register before using it.  In these versions it asks for your name, title, company that you work for and what you intend on using OghmaNano for.  This data is then transmitted to the OghmaNano server where it is securely stored. The reason I ask for this information is to be able generate accurate usage information. Having accurate information helps when requesting grants from funding bodies.  It's much easier to ask a funding body for money if you can prove you actually have users and your software is a benefit to society. Periodicity OghmaNano will also contact the OghmaNano server to see if there are any software updates. By using OghmaNano you agree for the above to happen.
