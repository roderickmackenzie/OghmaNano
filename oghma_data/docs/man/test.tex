\section{What is OghmaNano?} 

OghmaNano was originally developed to be a general purpose model for simulating photovoltaic devices, including organic and perovskite cells. However, since its initial development the model has expanded to simulate many other classes of optoelectronic devices including, Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), Organic Field Effect Transistors (OFETs), large area printed devices, optical filters, photonic crystals and
