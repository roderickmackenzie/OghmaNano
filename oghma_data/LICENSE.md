gpvdm_data
==========

Gpvdm_data contains all the physical material information needed for gpvdm to run.  It also includes manuals and documentation and in general anything which is not program code.  The physical data is collected from various sources. Including:

*Refractive index information: Most comes from refractiveindex.info, however I add useful materials as and when needed.

*Emission spectra: Most came from DOI: 10.1515/nanoph-2017-0021.

*CIE color spectra: Wikipedia

Where possible I have included a .bib file to document where the data came from.
